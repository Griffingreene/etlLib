# etlLib
This will be an ongoing module to assist with basic and eventually more complex ETL tasks. I am starting with a few funtions I wrote to perform basic transformations between file types and editing SQL tables. Stay tuned as I continue to expand and improve on this library; I want this to turn into something that I continue to use throughout my career.
